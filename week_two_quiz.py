# 2 --> UNICODE? Converting a sting to unicode -UTF8
"""
   Unicode is a universal character encoding standard that assigns a code to every 
   character and symbol in every language in the world.
   
   The difference between ASCII and Unicode is that ASCII represents lowercase letters (a-z),
   uppercase letters (A-Z), digits (0â€“9) and symbols such as punctuation marks while Unicode 
   represents letters of English, Arabic, Greek etc.... 
   
   UTF-8 is the most widely used way to represent Unicode text in web pages
   UTF-8 is a Unicode Transformation Format that uses 8-bit blocks to represent
   a character and is essential for software localization.
